# Meeting Minutes Template
A template for meeting minutes suitable for clubs and small organisations. This
template was created out of desire for having better consistency in meeting
minutes during my time at University. The template is divided into three
sections:

- Title Page (incl. attendees and absentees)
- Agenda
  - One additional page for each item on the agenda
- Tasks

## Usage
This template was created using LaTeX typesetting. I use `pdflatex` to compile
the document, so I would recommend that anyone else wishing to make use of this
template does the same. In order for the compilation to succeed, it is
necessary to place a `logo.{png/,jpg/,pdf}` file in the same directory as
`template.tex`. Then simply run:

`pdflatex template.tex`
